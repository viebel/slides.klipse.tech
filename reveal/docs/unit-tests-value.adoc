== Different levels of Automatic testing


|===
|Level of test| Purpose | Writing | Maintenance

|Integration tests | Prevent regression | Hard | ðŸ˜°
|Component tests   | Check functionality | Reasonable | ðŸ˜•
|Unit tests       | Code quality        | Easy  | ðŸ™‚

== Common Objections against automatic testing

[.fragment]
Q: The unit tests rarely catch bugs
[.fragment]
A: It's not the purpose of unit tests to catch bugs!

[.fragment]
Q: We have a very good QA team. Why do we need to write tests?
[.fragment]
A: It's not the purpose of unit tests to catch bugs!

[.fragment]
Q: Even if the unit tests pass, we need to test manually.
[.fragment]
A: It's not the purpose of unit tests to catch bugs!

== What is code quality?

[%step]
. Code that looks good
. Code that handles edge cases properly

== Common objections against unit tests

[.fragment]
Q: We spend too much time writing unit tests
[.fragment]
A: Catching edge cases requires efforts

[.fragment]
Q: The code works: Why should I waste time on writing a unit test?
[.fragment]
A: The code works: Why should I code review it?

[.fragment]
Q: The code works: Why should I waste time on writing a unit test?
[.fragment]
A: The code works: Why should I refactor it?


== Unit tests improve quality: design

[.fragment]
--
> Code quality criteria: how easy is it to test the code.
--

[.fragment]
--
[source.eval-javascript, javascript]
function helloWorld(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name + "!");
}
--

== Unit tests improve quality: edge cases

[.fragment]
--
[source.eval-javascript, javascript]
function caseInsensitiveMatch(text, query) {
  return text.match(new RegExp(query, 'i')) !== null;
}
--

[.fragment]
--
Let's test it!
--

[.fragment]
--
[source.eval-javascript, javascript]
caseInsensitiveMatch("hello", "hell") === true
--

[.fragment]
--
[source.eval-javascript, javascript]
caseInsensitiveMatch("hello", "Hell") === true
--

[.fragment]
--
[source.eval-javascript, javascript]
caseInsensitiveMatch("hello", "Halo") === false
--

[.fragment]
--
[source.eval-javascript, javascript]
caseInsensitiveMatch("hello", "h.llo") === false

== To mock or not to mock

If you need to mock, there are chances that you have an opportunity to improve the code quality.


== How many test cases?


[source, javascript]
function foo(a,b) {
  return [bar(a), kale(b)];
}

Assume that `a` can take 5 different values and `b` can take `7` different values.

How many test cases should we write?

== Don't be paranoid!

> When you test a function `foo` that calls a function `bar`, you assume that `bar` works properly.


== What code should we test?
[%step]

. Try to test everything.

. If it's too complicated, try to refactor.

. If it doesn't help, write a minimal test case.

. If it's too complicated, do not write a test.



== Should we test inner functions?

On one hand it's easier to test small functions.

On the other hand inner functions API might change, then it involves updating the unit tests.


== The child shower syndrome

Each time a child needs to get in the shower, he complains.

Once he is in the shower, he doesn't want to get out.

== Summary

. Unit tests objectives: code quality
.. Code looks good
.. Handle edge cases
. Writing unit tests should be a pleasure ðŸ§³
.. Refactor your code to make unit tests easier to write
.. Do not write too many test cases
.. Do not write test for code that is assumed to work
. Don't be too lazy ðŸš¿
