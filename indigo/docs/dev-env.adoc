== Use tools like a professional Clojure developer

TIP: Professional tools are never easy to use for beginners

== Homoiconicity

TIP: The syntax of the code is the same as the syntax of the data.

  "A dummy function"

===  Structural editing

TIP: Constraints are here to help you!

===  Structural navigation

{meditation}The code is a tree.

TIP: Never use arrow keys to navigate in your code

[source,clojure]
'(a b
  c
  [d.a d.b]
  (e.a [e.b.a (e.b.b.a e.b.b.b)]
    e.c)

{challenge} To navigate from `b` to `e.a`, we move _forward_ twice and _forward into sexp_ once

== The REPL

REPL comes from the LISP tradition

REPL is much more than a shell or a browser console

=== The REPL connected to the IDE

. Evaluate the form that ends at caret
. Evaluate top form
. Evaluate the whole buffer
. Comment block

=== Debug without a debugger

spy

== Homeworks

[.left.w60]
. Practice structural editing on your IDE
. Navigate the code without arrow keys
. Connect the REPL to your IDE
