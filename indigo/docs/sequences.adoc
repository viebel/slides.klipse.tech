* In terms of *performances*, it's not enough

=== List creation


[.fragment]
--
You can mix element of different types inside a list
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(list 1 2 "hello")
--

[.fragment]
--
You can nest lists inside lists inside lists inside lists...
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(list 1 2 (list "a" "b") (list 1.2 (list 3.43243 2.5)))
--

[.fragment]
--
There is a syntactic sugar for list creation: the single quote `'`
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
'(1 2 3)
--

[.fragment]
--
And it works fine with nested lists
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
'(1 2 ("a" "b" (1 2 4)))
--

=== Query on lists

[.fragment]
--
Get the first element of a list
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(first '(1 2 3 4 5))
--
[.fragment]
--
Check if the list is empty
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(empty? '(1 2 3 4 5))
--


=== Removing the first element of a list
[.fragment]
--
Create a *new* list without the first element
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(def a '(1 2 3 4 5))
(def b (rest a))
--

[.fragment]
--
The new list is changed
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
b
--

[.fragment]
--
The original list is left unchanged
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
a
--




=== Adding an element to a list


[.fragment]
--
Create a *new* list with an element prepended
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(def c '(1 2 3 4 5))
(def d (cons 0 c))
--

[.fragment]
--
The new list is changed
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
d
--

[.fragment]
--
The original list is left unchanged
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
c
--

The implementation of `cons`

== Vectors

*Vectors* are like *lists* but with *fast random access*.



=== Vector creation

[.fragment]
--
Vectors are created using `vector`
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(vector 1 2 3 4 5)
--

{bl}

[.fragment]
--
Nested vectors can be created using the literal `[]`
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(def a [1 2 3 4 "aa" [1 2] [1 2 3]])
a
--

=== Query on vectors

[.fragment]
--
Random access
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(nth ["a" "b" "c"] 2)
--

=== Modifying an entry in a vector

[.fragment]
--
Create a *new* vector with a modified entry
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(def v [0 1 2 3 4])
(def w (assoc v 2 200))
--

[.fragment]
--
The new vector is changed
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
w
--

[.fragment]
--
The original vector is left unchanged
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
v
--

=== Vectors vs lists

[.fragment]
{meditation} Why do we need lists if vectors has more features?

{bl}

[.fragment]
* Lists are more efficient in terms of memory
* For iterations, lists are more efficient in terms of CPU
* Deep argument: When a list is enough why would we use a vector?


== The sequence abstraction

. `first`
. `rest`
. `empty?`
. `cons`


That's the foundation of the rich set of Clojure data manipulation functions: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sort` ...


=== The sequence abstraction in action
[.fragment]
--
The sequence functions work on any data collection
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(first [1 2 3 4 5])
--

[.fragment]
--
Be careful: `rest` always returns a sequence!
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(rest [1 2 3 4 5])
--
[.fragment]
--
Be careful: `cons` always returns a sequence!
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(cons 0 [1 2 3 4 5])
--


{bl}
[.fragment]
--
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(empty? [1 2 3 4 5])
--


=== Sequence vs. list

[.fragment]
--
Sequences are printed like lists
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(rest [1 2 3 4 5])
--

[.fragment]
--
A sequence is not the same as a list
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(= (type (rest [1 2 3 4 5])) (type '(2 3 4 5)))
--

[.fragment]
--
Equality check the values, not the concrete sequence type

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(= (rest [1 2 3 4 5]) '(2 3 4 5))
--
[.fragment]
--
Equality check the values, not the concrete sequence type

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(= [1 2 3 4 5] '(1 2 3 4 5))
--



== Homework

=== Sequences - Practice

> Write a function that receives a sequence and returns its fifth element.

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(defn fifth [lst]
;; Write your code here
)

{bl}
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(assert (= (fifth '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)) 5))

=== Sequences - Practice (2)

> {challenge} Write a function that receives a number `n` and a sequence and returns its nth element. You'll need to use recursion.

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(defn nth-element [lst n])

{bl}

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(assert (= (nth-element '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11) 10) 10))


=== Sequences - Practice (3)

> {challenge} Write a function called `select-1-5-7` that receives a sequence and returns a sequence with the elements of the original sequence at positions 1, 5 and 7.

You might use either your `nth-element` function or clojure `nth`.

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(defn select-1-5-7 [lst])

{bl}

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(assert (= (select-1-5-7 (range 10)) '(0 4 6)))


=== Sequences - Practice (4)

> {challenge} Write a function called `my-map` that receives a function and a sequence and returns a sequence made of the application of the function to the elements of the sequence.

* You are allowed to use recursion.
* You are not allowed to use functions from `clojure.core` like `map`

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(defn my-map [f s])

{bl}

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(assert (= (my-map inc [1 2 3]) '(2 3 4)))
