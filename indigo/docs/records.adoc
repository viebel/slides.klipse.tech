== Practice

Create two records `Doctor` and `Mr` that implement three methods:

. `(title this)` - Returns the title of the person (e.g. `"Dr. Jekyll"` or `"Mr Hyde"`)
. `(greet this greeting)` - Return personal greeting (e.g. `"Hello Dr. Jekyll"`)
. `(rename this new-name)` - Change the name of a person


Guidelines:

* Test your code with the unit tests on next slide
* Define a protocol for each method
* Let `Doctor` and `Mr` give different names to their arguments
* Implement some of the record methods inside the record.
* Implement some of the record methods outside the record (with `extend-type`).
* When you test your code, explore the different ways to instantiate a record
* {challenge} Try to avoid implementing twice the exact same code (e.g. `greet`)

== Practice - Unit tests

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(assert (= (title (Doctor. "Jekyll"))
           "Dr. Jekyll"))
(assert (= (title (Mr. "Hyde"))
           "Mr. Hyde"))

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(assert (= (greet (map->Doctor {:name "Jekyll"}) "Hello")
           "Hello Dr. Jekyll"))
(assert (= (greet (map->Mr. {:my-name "Hyde"}) "Hello")
           "Hello Mr. Hyde"))
[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
(assert (= (title (rename (Doctor. "Jekyll") "Manhattan"))
           "Dr. Manhattan"))
(assert (= (title (rename (Mr. "Hyde") "T"))
           "Mr. T"))

== Solution

[source.eval-clojure, clojure]
--
(comment
(defprotocol IWithTitle
  (title [this]))

(defprotocol IGreet
  (greet [this greeting]))

(defprotocol IRenamable
  (rename [this new-name]))

(defn default-greet [person greeting]
  (str greeting " " (title person)))


(defrecord Doctor [name]
  IWithTitle
  (title [doctor] (str "Dr. " name))
  IGreet
  (greet [doctor greeting] (default-greet doctor greeting))
  IRenamable
  (rename [doctor new-name] (assoc doctor :name new-name)))


(defrecord Mr [my-name]
  IWithTitle
  (title [this] (str "Mr. " my-name))
  IGreet
  (greet [doctor greeting] (default-greet doctor greeting)))

(extend-type Mr
  IRenamable
  (rename [doctor new-name] (assoc doctor :my-name new-name)))
  )

== Deep insights

{meditation} No inheritance

{meditation} Defer implementation to a function that could be shared between records

{meditation} Records are immutable.

{meditation} It is better to have small protocols

{meditation} Usually, the name of a protocol starts with a `I`

{meditation} Inside a protocol, the object is named `this` while inside a records it is named specifically.

{meditation} Usually records are defined in separate namespaces

{meditation} When to use records instead of maps?

{meditation} Records can be extended from the outside

{meditation} A protocol is an aggregation of function signatures

{meditation} Various ways to instantiate a record
